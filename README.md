This repository contains some works of the DBMS course to study the memory management.

# Organization directory (B-Tree)
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree to know better about what we are talking about.

In there, you can find the implementation of the B-Tree organziation. More precisely, we have implemented the search, insertion and deletion methods.

# Algorithms directory
In there, you can find RAM management algorithms such as the clock algorithm (or second chance algorithm), fifo, or LRU (Least Recently Used)
And compare the misses between each other
